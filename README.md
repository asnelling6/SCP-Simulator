In order to use SCP-Simulator, scroll down to line 335 and change the arguments for SCP_Generate_And_Run_Traces. 
The syntax is (trace length, max distinct items, min cost, max cost, number of iterations). 

If you want to see SCP's stack over a specific trace, you can run SCP_steps over that trace. Examples have been provided on lines 337-339.
